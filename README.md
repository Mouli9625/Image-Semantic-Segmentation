ABSTARCT:
1) This project aimed to revolutionize training data for autonomous vehicles by exploring the potential of generative AI and large language models.
2) Utilized generative AI and large language models to revolutionize training data for autonomous vehicles.
3) Employed Stable Diffusion sdxl turbo, Lightning and V1-5 models and fine-tuning for road scenarios to generate diverse images of highways, streets, and road users.
4) Developed auto-labeling techniques and trained a fine tuned YOLO model to segment objects such as road markings and pedestrians.
5) Salesforce Blip image captioning large model was utilized for generating the caption for the image.
6) Developed a labeled dataset of common road scenarios to improve self-driving car perception systems, enhancing safety and intelligence.
